# Trapezoidal Segmented Regression

This repository contains code to compute the trapezoidal segmented regression of a set of 2D points.  The method and code are explained in this paper:

> Booth BM and Narayanan S. "Trapezoidal Segmented Regression: A Novel Continuous-scale Real-time Annotation Approximation Algorithm." Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), 2019 Eighth International Conference on, 2019.

The code performing TSR is located in `src/trapezoidal_segmented_regression/continuous_opt.py`. Some total variation denoising scripts and supporting code for the paper are contained in this repository as well.

If you discover any bugs, or if you find this code useful, I would love to hear so.  You can find my contact information on GitHub.
